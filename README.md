##Project Objective

Direct digital synthesis (DDS) is a method of producing an analog waveform—usually a sine
wave—by generating a time-varying signal in digital form and then performing a digital-to-analog
conversion. Because operations within a DDS device are primarily digital, it can offer fast
switching between output frequencies, fine frequency resolution, and operation over a broad
spectrum of frequencies. A direct digital synthesizer operates by storing the points of a
waveform in digital format, and then recalling them to generate the waveform. The rate at which
the synthesizer completes one waveform then governs the frequency.
